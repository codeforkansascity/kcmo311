kcmo311
=======

KCMO has approached Code for KC about improving their 311 public service system, which integrates with the city’s open data portal at http://data.kcmo.gov. We are working on a citizen engagement app that will display new and resolved 311 issues, produce a message of the day and increase access to other related 311 information. This project is a single web page using jQuery to access KCMO’s 311 data, and a Google Doc.
